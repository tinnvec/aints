# screeps-typescript-starter

> Starter kit for [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)-based [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) AI codes.

`screeps-typescript-starter` is a starter kit for building [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) AIs in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). It is based on [the original starter kit](https://github.com/MarkoSulamagi/Screeps-typescript-sample-project) by [Marko SulamÃ¤gi](https://github.com/MarkoSulamagi), but with extra tools for easy compiling/deploying of scripts to the Screeps server, as well as a base framework for running tests.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (latest LTS is recommended)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - Optional. You can use `npm` if you don't want to, but this is for your own sanity.
* Gulp 4.0+ - `yarn global add gulpjs/gulp.git#4.0`

For testing:

* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test runner and [NYC](https://istanbul.js.org/) for code coverage - `yarn global add nyc mocha`

### Quick setup

To get started, [download a zipped copy](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter/archive/master.zip) of the starter kit and extract it somewhere.

First, you will have to set up your config files. Create a copy of `config.example.json` and rename it to `config.json`. Then navigate into the `src/config` directory, create a copy of `config.example.ts` and rename it to `config.ts`.

```bash
# config.json
$ cp config.example.json config.json

# config.ts
$ cd src/config
$ cp config.example.ts config.ts
```

Then, on the `config.json` file, change the `username` and `password` properties with your Screeps credentials.

The `config.json` file is where you set up your development environment. If you want to push your code to another branch, for example, if you have some sort of a staging branch where you test around in Simulation mode, we have left a `branch` option for you to easily change the target branch of the upload process. The `default` branch is set as the default.

Set `"autobranch": true` instead of explicit `branch` name to use your current git branch name when uploading. You still have to create matching branch in screeps client by cloning an existing branch (API limitation). This is useful when setting up deployment pipelines that upload on commit after successful build (so a commit to `major_refactoring` branch doesn't overwrite your default branch in the middle of epic alliance action just because you forgot to update a pipeline configuration).

The `src/config/config.ts` file is where you store your code-specific config variables. For example, if you want to easily turn on `PathFinder` when needed, you can set your own variable here. Once you've set up your configs, import the `config.ts` file on the file you want to call these configs at:

```js
import * as Config from "../path/to/config";
```

Then simply call the config variables with `Config.CONFIG_VARIABLE`.

**WARNING: DO NOT** commit these files into your repository!

### Installing modules

Then run the following the command to install the required packages and TypeScript declaration files.

```bash
$ yarn
```

### Running the compiler

```bash
# To compile your TypeScript files on the fly
$ npm start

# To deploy the code to Screeps
$ npm run deploy
```

You can also use `deploy-prod` instead of `deploy` for a bundled version of the project, which has better performance but is harder to debug.

`deploy-local` will copy files into a local folder to be picked up by steam client and used with the official or a private server.

You can override the branch to upload to by supplying an addition `--branch` argument.

```bash
# upload to branch "tempbranch" instead of configured branch
# note: npm requires additional arguments to be separated with a double dash: --
$ npm run deploy -- --branch tempbranch
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

To enable tests as part of the build and deploy process, flip the `test` flag in your `config.json` to `true`.

You can always run tests by running `npm test`. You can get a code coverage report by running
`npm test:coverage`. Then opening `coverage/index.html` in your browser.

### Writing Tests

All tests should go in the `test/` directory and end in the extension `.test.ts`.

All constants are available globally as normal.

The game state is no simulated, so you must mock all game objects and state that your code requires.
As part of this project, we hope to provide some helpers for generating game objects.

It is recommended to test the smallest pieces of your code at a time. That is, write tests that
assert the behavior of single, small functions. The advantages of this are:

1. less mocking to setup and maintain
2. allows you to test behavior, not implementation

See [test/components/creeps/creepActions.test.ts](test/components/creeps/creepActions.test.ts) as
an example on how to write a test, including the latest game object mocking support.

For writing assertions we provide [chai](http://chaijs.com). Check out their
[documentation](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/) to learn how to write assertions in your tests.

**Important:** In your tests, if you want to use lodash you must import it explicitly to avoid errors:

```js
import * as _  from "lodash"
```

## Notes

### Sample code

This starter kit includes a bit of sample code, which uses some of the new TS2 features mentioned earlier. Feel free to build upon this as you please, but if you don't want to use them, you can remove everything from within the `src/` directory and start from scratch.

When starting from scratch, make sure a `main.ts` file exists with a `loop()` function. This is necessary in order to run the game loop.

### The `noImplicitAny` compiler flag

TypeScript developers disagree about whether the `noImplicitAny` flag should be `true` or `false`. There is no correct answer and you can change the flag later. But your choice now can make a difference in larger projects so it merits discussion.

When the `noImplicitAny` flag is `false` (the default), the compiler silently defaults the type of a variable to `any` if it cannot infer the type based on how the variable is used.

When the `noImplicitAny` flag is `true` and the TypeScript compiler cannot infer the type, it still generates the JavaScript files. But it also reports an error. Many seasoned developers prefer this stricter setting because type checking catches more unintentional errors at compile time.

In this starter kit, the `noImplicitAny` is set to `true` for a more stricter environment. If you don't like this, you can change the `noImplicitAny` flag to `false` on the `tsconfig.json` file.

### TSLint

TSLint checks your TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors, and can also enforce coding style standards.

After each successful compiling of the project, TSLint will parse the TypeScript source files and display a warning for any issues it will find.

You can change the file paths checked automatically by editing the paths in the `tslint` section of `config.json`.

This project provides TSLint rules through a `tslint.json` file, which extends the recommended set of rules from TSLint github repository: https://github.com/palantir/tslint/blob/next/src/configs/recommended.ts

We made some changes to those rules, which we considered necessary and/or relevant to a proper Screeps project:

 - set the [forin](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/forin/) rule to `false`, it was forcing `for ( ... in ...)` loops to check if object members were not coming from the class prototype.
 - set the [interface-name](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/interface-name/) rule to `false`, in order to allow interfaces that are not prefixed with `I`.
 - set the [no-console](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/no-console/) rule to `false`, in order to allow using `console`.
 - in the [variable-name](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/variable-name/) rule, added `allow-leading-underscore`.

If you believe that some rules should not apply to a part of your code, you can use flags to let TSLint know about it: https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/

**More info about TSLint:** https://palantir.github.io/tslint/

### Source maps

Works out of the box with "npm run deploy-prod" and default values from src/config/config.example.ts. Links back to source control when possible (currently understands only github and gitlab). Code has to be committed at build time and pushed to remote at run time for this to work correctly.

Doesn't work in sim, because they do lots of evals with scripts in sim.

Currently maps are generated, but "source-maps" module doesn't get uploaded for non-webpack builds.

Log level and output can be controlled from console by setting level, showSource and showTick properties on log object.

```js
// print errors only, hide ticks and source locations
log.level = 1;
log.showSource = false;
log.showTick = false;
```

![Console output example](/console.png "Console output example")

**Note:** The built-in URL template only works on GitHub and GitLab. If you use Bitbucket, replace `LOG_VSC_URL_TEMPLATE` on your `config.ts` with this:

```ts
export const LOG_VSC_URL_TEMPLATE = (path: string, line: string) => {
  const parts = path.split('/');
  const filename: string = parts[parts.length - 1];
  return `${LOG_VSC.repo}/src/${LOG_VSC.revision}/${path}?fileviewer=file-view-default#${filename}-${line}`;
};
```
