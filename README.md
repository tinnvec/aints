# AInts (WIP)

Screeps AI using ants and other social colony insects as a model.

## Foraging

1. Check Surroundings
    - Spawn nearby
      - Creep empty
        - Switch to/ensure search mode
    - Source nearby
      - Source not empty, creep not full nor empty
        - Switch to/ensure homing mode
    - Creep is fatigued
      - Increase steps from last site
2. Deposit Pheromone
    - Amount
      - Increase level to `(Max level - steps from last site) * per-step change`
      - Max level
        - `CostMatrix` max value (255)
      - Min level
        - Enough that the pheromone won't decay completely within longest action time (ie. harvesting)
      - Per-step change
        - `(max level - min level) / max search length`
    - Pheromone type
      - Search Mode
        - homing pheromone
      - Homing Mode
        - previous search pheromone.
        - If max search steps was reached, don't deposit pheromones while homing
3. Take Action
    - Spawn nearby
      - Creep not empty
        - Transfer energy to spawn
    - Source nearby
      - Creep not full
        - Harvest energy
    - Search too long
      - Switch to homing mode
4. Move
    - Creep not harvesting nor fatigued
      - Move to tile with highest value for `(2 * search pheromone) - deposit pheromone`
        - Increase steps from last site on successful move


## Spawning

- Spawn as many creeps as possible
