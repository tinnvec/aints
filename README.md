Screeps AI using Ant behavior as a model.

Outline
===

- Spawn
  - Pheromone sensing range?
  - Secrete SP?
  - Creating Creeps
    - Min foragers (2?)
    - Increase max foragers with more EP nearby

- Forager Creep
  - Not Carrying Energy / Hunting
    1. Increase SP at current position by Max(lowest SP of neighboring locations, MaxPossiblePheromone / DistanceFromSpawn)
    2. Move to neighboring location with lowest value of (SP - (2 * EP))
    3. At MST, switch to homing, even if no energy found

  - Carrying Energy / Homing
    1. Increase EP at current position by Max(lowest EP of neighboring locations, MaxPossiblePheromone / DistanceFromSource)
      - Combine with source size?
    2. Move to neighboring location with lowest value of (EP - (2 * SP)) combined with DistanceFromSpawn
    3. Feed spawn with available capacity
    4. Fill container/storage with available capacity
      - Recruit others for group harvesting if source is large enough/has enough access?

- Key
  - EP = Energy Pheromone
  - SP = Spawn Pheromone
  - MST = Max Search Time
